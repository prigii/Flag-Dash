# Project Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and improvements for future versions of Flag Dash. These ideas aim to enhance user engagement, educational value, and overall fun.

## Short-Term Goals (Next Up)

-   [ ] **Sound Effects:** Add simple, satisfying sound effects for correct/incorrect answers and button clicks.
-   [ ] **UI Animations:** Implement more fluid animations for transitions between screens and feedback on answers.
-   [ ] **Accessibility Improvements:** Conduct a full accessibility audit (WCAG) to ensure the app is usable for everyone, including improving color contrast and ARIA attributes.
-   [ ] **Refactor into Sub-components:** Break down the monolithic `App.tsx` into smaller, reusable components (`Menu`, `GameBoard`, `StatsPage`, `Button`) for better maintainability.

## Medium-Term Goals

-   [ ] **More Game Modes:**
    -   **"Capital City" Mode:** Guess the capital city of a given country.
    -   **"Shape" Mode:** Guess the country based on its outline.
-   [ ] **Achievements System:** Reward players with badges for milestones (e.g., "Answer 100 questions correctly," "Master the Europe region," "Get a perfect score on Hard").
-   [ ] **Themes:** Allow users to choose between different color themes (e.g., light, dark, sepia).

## Long-Term / Ambitious Goals

-   [ ] **Online Leaderboards:** Implement a backend service and user authentication to allow players to compete for high scores globally or with friends.
-   [ ] **Multiplayer Mode:** Create a real-time mode where two players can compete head-to-head.
-   [ ] **User Accounts:** Allow users to create accounts to sync their statistics across multiple devices.
-   [ ] **Localization:** Translate the app interface into multiple languages.

This roadmap is a living document and is subject to change based on user feedback and project priorities.
